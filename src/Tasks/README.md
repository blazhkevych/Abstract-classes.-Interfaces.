# Programming Tasks

This repository contains Java programs that address various programming tasks. Each task is implemented as a separate
class with associated methods. Below is an overview of each task:

## Task 1: Human, Builder, Sailor, Pilot

Create a class `Human` containing information about a person. Implement three subclasses (`Builder`, `Sailor`,
and `Pilot`) using inheritance. Each subclass should include necessary methods related to their respective roles.

## Task 2: Animal Hierarchy - Tiger, Crocodile, Kangaroo

Implement a base class `Animal` and derived classes (`Tiger`, `Crocodile`, `Kangaroo`). Use constructors to set the name
and characteristics of each animal. Implement required methods and fields for each class.

## Task 3: Money and Product

Create a `Money` class for handling currency. Include fields for the whole and fractional parts. Implement methods for
displaying the amount and setting values. Create a `Product` class based on `Money` to manage product prices. Implement
a method to reduce the price by a specified amount.

## Task 4: Device Hierarchy - Kettle, Microwave, Car, Ship

Define a base class `Device` and derived classes (`Kettle`, `Microwave`, `Car`, `Ship`). Use constructors to set the
name and characteristics of each device. Implement methods (`Sound`, `Show`, `Desc`) for displaying information about
each device.

## Task 5: Musical Instruments - Violin, Trombone, Ukulele, Cello

Create a base class `MusicalInstrument` and derived classes (`Violin`, `Trombone`, `Ukulele`, `Cello`). Use constructors
to set the name and characteristics of each instrument. Implement methods (`Sound`, `Show`, `Desc`, `History`) for each
class.

## Task 6: IMath Interface and Array

Implement an interface `IMath` with methods (`Max`, `Min`, `Avg`). Create a class `Array` that implements this
interface. The class should provide functionality to find the maximum, minimum, and average values of an array.

## Task 7: ISort Interface and Array

Create an interface `ISort` with methods (`SortAsc`, `SortDesc`). Implement the interface in the `Array` class to
provide sorting functionalities - ascending and descending. Test the sorting capabilities using sample arrays.

Feel free to explore each task individually by uncommenting the corresponding method calls in the `Main` class. Happy
coding!
